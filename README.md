# AI Healthcare Project

### Unified Platform for Medical Imaging, Deep Learning & Genomics

This repository is dedicated to exploring **AI applications in healthcare**, bridging **medical imaging**, **machine learning**, and **bioinformatics**.  
It aims to develop intelligent tools that enhance medical research, diagnosis, and understanding of human health.

## Focus Areas
- **Medical Imaging (DICOM, MRI, CT)** — Visualization, 3D reconstruction, and HU analysis  
- **AI & Deep Learning (CNNs, ML Models)** — Disease detection and diagnostic prediction  
- **Genomic Data Analysis** — Gene sequencing, mutation detection, and feature extraction  
- **Data Processing Pipelines** — Anonymization, augmentation, and healthcare data workflows  

## Goal
To build an end-to-end **AI Healthcare ecosystem** integrating:
> DICOM + Deep Learning + Genomics → Smarter, data-driven healthcare insights.

## Current Modules
| Module | Description | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| DICOM Viewer | Visualize and anonymize medical scans | ✅ Completed |
| CNN Models | Deep learning for medical classification | 🔜 In progress |
| Gene Sequencing | Analyze genomic data using ML | 🔜 Planned |
| 3D Reconstruction | Anatomical visualization (VTK/ITK) | 🔜 Planned |
